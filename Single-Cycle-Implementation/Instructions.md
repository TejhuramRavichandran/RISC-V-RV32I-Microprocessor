## âœ… I-Type Instructions

## âœ… B-Type Instructions (Branch)

```assembly
li x5, 10
li x6, 10
li x7, 5

beq x5, x6, equal_label    # If x5 == x6, branch

## âœ… J-Type Instructions (Jump and Link)

```assembly

li x6, 200                 # Skipped

jump_label:

li x7, return_here
jal x8, subroutine         # Jump to subroutine, save return in x8

return_here:
addi x8, x8, 4             # Adjust return address
j end_of_program

subroutine:
li x9, 500
jalr x0, x7, 0             # Return to return_here

end_of_program:

## âœ… Memory Instructions

```assembly
li x5, 0x1000              # Assume memory address 0x1000
li x6, 1234
sw x6, 0(x5)               # Store word at address x5

li x7, 0xABCD
sh x7, 2(x5)               # Store half-word at x5 + 2

li x8, 0xEF
sb x8, 3(x5)               # Store byte at x5 + 3

lw x9, 0(x5)               # Load word
lh x10, 2(x5)              # Load half-word
lb x11, 3(x5)              # Load byte
lhu x12, 2(x5)             # Load unsigned half-word
lbu x13, 3(x5)             # Load unsigned byte
```

## âœ… U-Type Instructions

```assembly
lui x5, 0x12345            # x5 = 0x12345000 (Upper Immediate)
lui x6, 0xFFFFF            # x6 = 0xFFFFF000 (Sign-extension check)

auipc x7, 0x1              # x7 = PC + 0x1000
auipc x8, 0xABCDE          # x8 = PC + 0xABCDE000
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- `li` (load immediate) is a pseudo-instruction. It's expanded into actual instructions like `lui` and `addi`.
- Bitwise and arithmetic shifts use modulo 32 of the shift amount (`rs2` or immediate).
- The instruction flow control (`beq`, `jal`, etc.) affects which instructions are skipped or executed.
- Memory access instructions assume the memory at the given addresses is valid and aligned.
